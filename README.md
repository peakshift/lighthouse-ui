# Proposal ‚Äî Accessiblity

*Our proposal is to make lighthouse and Eth2.0 more accessiable ‚Äî it goes outside of the scope of the RFP as the goal is to form an ongoing and open collaboration even after this project is finalised on the business side.*

**Current State of Lighthouse UX**

Lighthouse is under heavy development and as the Eth2.0 protocol still faces frequent changes ‚Äî we take into consideration we understand that "we are working on shaky grounds".

That being said there are several points we need to hit in order to provide a good overall user experience towards adoption of lighthouse / access and usability of the Eth2.0 network. I would categorise these efforts under Developer Experience and Operator Tooling. I belilve these initiatives can/should be worked on in parallel.

- Local Dev Mode (Phase 0)
  - Quick Setup for those wanting to start interacting with the Becaon Chain + Validator APIs locally
- Launch new Private Network
  - Experince the Beacon Chain and Validators in a sandbox environment.
- Join the Lighthosue Public Testnet
  - In order to participate in the testing of the protocol implementation at Phase 0

### üåä ‚öìÔ∏è ü¶ë
*Personally, I think we missed a great branding opportunity with the naming of releases after lighthouses and maritime things.* 

...

We know that Rust is a language you can trust a system like Eth2.0 to be written in, there are lighthouses still stand strongly even while being battered. They stand securly as beacons* towards safety...

*Make Lighthouses Great Again!*

When we start testing for client interopabiltiy ‚Äî Growing the Lighthouse Public testnet from now is going to be a fundimental.

Implementations in more "sexy", shinny and and user friendly languages ‚Äî and have seen growth in contributors and testnet tooling. 

*Lets make Lighthouse sexy again!*

---

A Lighthouse UI to manage validators and monitor the beacon-chain is proposed and is currently open in the bidding process.

### Beacon Chain

- Connect to a Beacon Chain

### Validator

- Create a Validator
  - Deposits through a Web3 Browser
- Connect a Validator
- Validator Actions
  - Start
  - Fund
  - Stop
    - Warn/Confirm
  - Exit Voluntarily
  - Widthdraw Earnings
  - Remove (from UI)
- Validator Observe Modes
  - Exit Timeline
  - System Status
  - Account
      - Earnings
      - Balance
  - Connected Peers

### Notes
Ability to submit deposits to the Eth1 deposit contract via the  [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)  browser extension
  - Working within Electron this will require its own of key management system

Questions
  - Will the interface include an account manager?
    - No since we‚Äôre using meta mask.
  - Do beacon nodes need a privateKey?
  - Is the primary user interested in using lighthouse ui to inspect global state or only the state of their own node?
  - Why does SigmaPrime want to build their own UI for Shasper (Eth2.0)
  - When is the TestNet going to be launched?
  - Why is MetaMask a requirement?
    - limitation = single mnemonic, node operator has to export private keys from mnemonic losing track of the derivation path
  - How are accounts created in lighthouse-cli ? does it use mnemonics or private keys (hex)
  - Do validators want to store their private keys in meta mask?
  - Who is this the primary target user of the lighthouse-ui?
  - Given a user has multiple validators : multiple private keys (mnemonics)
    - Each key will have to be added to MetaMask in order  perform write actions when the validator s selected.
    - How might we correctly select the account for signing the transactions for a specific validator
    - Accounts will have to be switched after 
Other Question
  - What is Sigma Primes goals for lighthouse?
  - What role does Sigma Prime in-vision lighthouse to have in the Eth2.0 ecosystem?
